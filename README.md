# LinkCraft Pro

LinkCraft Pro is an HTTP handler designed to create URL redirections based on predefined paths. This exercise aims to implement the necessary methods in handler.go to achieve the redirection functionality, simulating a URL shortener.

## Exercise Details

The primary goal is to create an HTTP handler that analyzes the path of incoming web requests and redirects users accordingly. For example, if there is a predefined redirect for /dogs to https://www.somesite.com/a-story-about-dogs, any incoming requests to /dogs should be redirected to the specified URL.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Implement Methods in `handler.go`:** Begin by implementing the stubbed-out methods in `handler.go` as described in the provided comments.

2. **Focus on `MapHandler`:** Initially, concentrate on implementing the `MapHandler` function. You can comment out the code in `main.go` related to `YAMLHandler`.

3. **YAML Parsing:** Utilize the `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` package to parse YAML data. If not installed, use `go get gopkg.in/yaml.v2` to install it.

4. **Convert Data into a Map:** After successfully parsing YAML, convert the data into a map.

5. **Finalize `YAMLHandler`:** Use the `MapHandler` to finalize the `YAMLHandler` implementation. The resulting code might resemble the following:

   ```go
   func YAMLHandler(yaml []byte, fallback http.Handler) (http.HandlerFunc, error) {
       parsedYaml, err := parseYAML(yaml)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }
       pathMap := buildMap(parsedYaml)
       return MapHandler(pathMap, fallback), nil
   }

   ```

6. **Create Supporting Functions:** Develop supporting functions like parseYAML and buildMap as needed.
